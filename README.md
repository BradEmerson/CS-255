Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a software request from a client named Liam who endeavored to create a computer-based system that aspiring drivers could use.  The system would provide course materials, test materials, and a medium through which they could schedule practical in-person driving practice sessions and tests, with live instructors and a provided vehicle.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I paid great attention to detail on all of my diagrams.  I was very careful to include every aspect of the DriverPass transcript that I could translate into objective diagram components.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I honestly put forth my best effort on every last one of the documents I provided, and spent hours revising them according to the provided information, and received a perfect score- so I would not revise any of them.  As far as improvements however, I believe that in most cases there is always a way to improve, so I given a real-life scenario, I would hold a conference with the client in person or on phone call to obtain more specific information from them about what they'd like out of their product.  There were quite a few items left open for interpretation that needed clarity.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I did my best to take the user's needs from the transcript and turn them into objective requirements, whether functional, non-functional, business, or technical.  The end user is the focal point of *almost* any software, and thus the experience of the user will determine whether the software is ultimately successful or unsuccessful.  If the users don't like the software (assuming they're using it voluntarily), they will find better software to use that does the same thing in a manner that they do like, assuming they can find someone to develop it.  As long as we have a free market this will hold true, and competition will ensure that there is always room to improve on a product until the user/customer is satisfied with it.  In summary, the user determines whether or not the software is profitable, or successful.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

This is an incredibly broad, open-ended question that could be interpreted in a large variety of ways- but I'll do my best to answer it.  I approach software design by first trying to objectively determine the needs of the client, then create a requirements document and review it with the client.  Afterwards, I would create some UML diagrams, and perhaps some easily understood flow charts to ensure that the client and I have the same vision for their software.  Once the design documents/diagrams have all been reviewed and approved by the client, I would (most likely with a team) have a brainstorming session to suggest any possible improvements or modifications for improved efficiency or functionality, and then have another meeting with the client for approval.  Afterwards, work could begin on coding/building the software project.
